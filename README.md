# vue-weather

With this mini poject I want to showcase my frontend skillset and the way I think about developing modern apps. 

As matter of preference I like to work with real data, therefore the frontend uses free API from [Open Weather](https://openweathermap.org/). 

The source code can be seen here: https://github.com/kwiat1990/vue-weather.
